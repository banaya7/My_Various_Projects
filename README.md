# Project Title

My third semester Coding Projects.

## Description

Here is my initiation into Github. I hope it is a long journey, but for now I will start here with the first coding projects I did.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

There are several libraries needed to be installed to run the laptopsaver project

### Installing

You can pull my project from here, and purchase a raspberry pi. Also a raspberry pi pico is needed along with a kit of wires and a breadboard. When all of the materials are aquired. The code can be run

### Executing program

For the laptop saver project there is just a kasa smart plug, and a raspberry pi that need to be connected to the same internet. once that you have to modiofy the code a little bit, but it will work once everything is hooked up, and the laptop is conected to the smartplug and charging. 

## Help

There are many great resources online to learn how to work with raspberry pis. If you need help explaining my code just let me know.
